## Aim

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the **number 1 cause of death globally**, taking an estimated **17.9 million lives each year**, which accounts for **31% of all deaths worlwide**.  
  
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure. 
  
Because most cardiovascular diseases are preventable, people with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.  
  
Therefore, in this study, ***it is aimed to create a model to predict the mortality caused by Heart Failure by using the Artificial Neural Network Model.***
